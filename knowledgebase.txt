Frequently Asked Questions about Electricity Billing:

As per Practice Direction issued by the Regulator – 26th March 2020 MERC, “the Distribution Licensees may suspend other non-essential services which require visiting consumer premises or meeting consumer in person i.e. Meter reading, Billing, Offline Bill Collection at Bill Payment Centers, release of new connections etc.” 

An Average bill Average units are worked as an arithmetic average of past 3 months consumption based on actual meter reading.

Received an average bill If for any reason the actual reading of your meter could not be taken due to some unavoidable circumstances and the meter has a status other than normal reading, an average bill is sent for the current month.

Different meter status shown on electricity bills are as follows:

Faulty : If meter is found faulty / non-working
Lock : If consumer premises are found locked while meter reading
Meter change : Meter replaced but new meter details not available in system
Inaccessible : If meter display is not visible
RNT (Reading Not Taken) : No reading taken by meter reader.

As per precautionary measures and guidelines given by MERC for the COVID-19 pandemic, activities such as Meter reading, testing, Bill distribution, sub divisional offices which required human interaction were closed and only essential services related to Power supply were operational.
 Due to this situation bills were calculated on an average as per directives. 
 However after declaration of mission begin again, MSEDCL has started meter reading activity in the field excluding containment areas, with the permission of district authorities.


You can submit your meter reading through Mahavitaran app or through the portal. MSEDCL has assigned a scheduled date for meter reading of each consumer, in every month. The self reading submission facility is enabled only for 5 days before the scheduled date of meter reading. Every consumer is requested through SMS for sending self reading up to scheduled reading date.

a Self reading submission through Mahavitaran App :

If you are a registered user, login to the Mahavitaran App
On the main menu select Submit Reading option to submit your reading




MSEDCL requests an additional security deposit as per the conditions of supply. All State Electricity Boards are empowered to collect a security deposit from their consumers. This deposit is necessary because consumers pay their bills after consuming electricity, typically with a delay of about two months. In case a consumer defaults on payment, MSEDCL may only disconnect the supply after providing due notice, allowing for further usage without payment. Therefore, a security deposit equivalent to one month's electricity consumption is collected from monthly billed domestic consumers. This deposit helps mitigate losses in such cases. Additionally, MSEDCL pays interest on security deposits of Rs. 50 or more at the rate equal to the post office saving bank rate.

To become an MSEDCL consumer and obtain a new connection, you need to follow these steps:
You must be the lawful owner or occupier of the premises where the connection is required.
Apply in the A-1 form at the respective section office for domestic or commercial connections, or at the sub-division/division office for industrial connections, along with any required no objection certificates.
After a load survey, you will receive a quotation for payment of charges, including service connection charges, service line charges, and security deposit.
Upon payment of the required charges, submit a test report from a licensed electrical contractor for the wiring.
The service connection will be released as per the chronological order after all formalities are completed.


Is the procedure for Billing After installation, the billing section receives data containing meter details and initial meter readings. Bills are issued monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly for different consumer categories. Payment is to be made by the last due date shown on the bill.

To increase the sanctioned load: Domestic, commercial, and industrial (LT) consumers should apply to the respective sectional and sub-divisional in charge.
HT consumers should apply to the Superintending Engineer.

After confirming feasibility, the load is sanctioned, and a quotation is issued, which includes additional service line charges.
To check one's consumption, Consumption depends on appliance capacity and usage period. Consumers can estimate their consumption using the provided link.

For billing complaints, contact the division office in urban areas or the distribution center or sub-divisional office in rural areas.
For major faults, restoration may take longer.
